## When publishing your results

We hope that the data you obtain with Subaru Telescope will achieve its intended science goals. All papers which make use of data taken with Subaru Telescope facilities should include the following acknowledgment on the title page as a footnote to the title.

> This research is based [in part] on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. We are honored and grateful for the opportunity of observing the Universe from Maunakea, which has the cultural, historical, and natural significance in Hawaii.

When such a Subaru-related paper has been published, we would appreciate it if you could inform us of its information (preferably with [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) Bibliographic Code Query) by mailing to "observers-infodesk -at- naoj.org".

In addition, here is a list of instrument citations which should be used when referring to any of the Subaru instruments.

We also encourage you to consider allowing NAOJ to undertake a public release of your data.
